If query is an IP address, return a list of prefixes and the
corresponding AS that is announcing each prefix.  Return type:
  std::vector<std::tuple<Ipv4Prefix,uint32_t,std::string>>

If query is an AS number, return a list of prefixes being
announced by the AS, coalesced.  Return type:
  std::tuple<uint32_t,string,std::vector<Ipv4Prefix>>

If query is a country code, return a list of prefixes being
announced by ASes in that country.  Most of the time I want
a coalesced list.  However, I might also just want a list
of ASes with the prefixes for each AS as a sublist.  Separate
query?
